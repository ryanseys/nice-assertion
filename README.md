nice-assertion
==============

nice-assertion is a small python-based (Flask) webapp for showing a nicer, more informative Persona assertion.

Setup
==========

1. Clone this bitch and install Flask (`pip install Flask`)

How To Use
==========

1. Start the server (`python assertion.py`) and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
2. Paste your raw assertion into the big box that tells you so
3. Click 'Submit'.

You will either be presented with a nicer assertion or an error (either you fucked up or I did; let me know if was the latter)
