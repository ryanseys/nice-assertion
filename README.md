nice-assertion
==============
nice-assertion is a small python-based (Flask) webapp for showing a nicer, more informative Persona assertion.

Demo
====
http://assertion.herokuapp.com

Setup
==========
1. Clone this bitch and install Flask (`$ pip install Flask`)

How To Use
==========
1. Start the server (`$ python assertion.py`) and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
2. Paste your raw assertion into the big box that tells you so.
3. Click 'Submit'.
4. Hakuna Matata.

You will either be presented with a nicer assertion or an error (either you fucked up or I did; let me know if it was the latter)
